# Recursive
Program created to apply recursion.

## Definition
Sum the elements of an array, and multiply it by the depth value. Every time there is an array inside
the array, the depth increase.

##Complexity Time/Space 
Time: O(N) -> N equivalent to each node from the arrays  
Space: O(D) -> where D is equivalent to the number of depth
